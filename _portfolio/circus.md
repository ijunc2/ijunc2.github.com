Last weekend(1/21/2018), I have launched my service named ['*Yusic*'](http://yusic.ijunc2.com) which is a compound word(Youtube + Music). *Yusic* has been providing a music video to people who like K-pop, expecially from underground singers from Youtube. The reason I made the *Yusic* is that I figured out that there are many foreigner(not korean) who like K-pop in USA. As a result, I have made the *Yusic*. Even though it has simple functions, I used a variable of skills like Async, DessignPattern, Rx, React etc.
