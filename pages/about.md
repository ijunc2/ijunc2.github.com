Hi, I am a student who has some experiences as a programer for five years. When I was in Korea, I had worked for five years. I've participated some projects. I like learning the newest technology. Even though it is difficult for me to just know what kind of things I have to study, I am making efforts to be a good programer.

I am accustomed to back-end side, yet, nowadays, I am interested in front-end such as react.(actually, i am only interested in react :) )
