For batching works, in other words, executing works which takes for a long time, we often use the *Async*. In this case,  We can use @Async easily in ***Spring Framework***. But, using @Async is so dangerous without customizing @Async. So, today, I am going to talk about the way that is how to custumize @Async(TaskExecutor). 

At first, Why is using @Async dangerous? If you use @Async expect customization, Spring Framework runs @Async with [***SimpleAsynTaskExecutor***](https://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring-framework/3.2.14.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/task/SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor.html) which is a basic class for Async. Actually, In your company, using the ***SimpleAsynTaskExecutor*** is very bad because whenever you execute asynchronous working which has lots of jobs, Spring Framework always makes new workers that even don't have a job which is to cache it. So, using @Async without customization is very dangerous because making new threads consume many resources than other works.

Then, how do we customize the @Async? It is to make @Bean of [***ThreadPoolTaskExecutor***](https://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring-framework/3.2.8.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/concurrent/ThreadPoolTaskExecutor.html) and to return this bean. [***ThreadPoolTaskExecutor***](https://docs.spring.io/autorepo/docs/spring-framework/3.2.8.RELEASE/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/concurrent/ThreadPoolTaskExecutor.html) helps us to customize almost options of the thread provied by Java.

What functions do options have each other? 
1. **setCorePoolSize**
- public void setCorePoolSize(int corePoolSize)
- Set the ThreadPoolExecutor's core pool size. Default is 1.
- This setting can be modified at runtime, for example through JMX.
2. **setQueueCapacity**
- public void setQueueCapacity(int queueCapacity)
- Set the capacity for the ThreadPoolExecutor's BlockingQueue. Default is Integer.MAX_VALUE.
- Any positive value will lead to a LinkedBlockingQueue instance; any other value will lead to a SynchronousQueue instance.
3. **setMaxPoolSize**
- public void setMaxPoolSize(int maxPoolSize)
- Set the ThreadPoolExecutor's maximum pool size. Default is Integer.MAX_VALUE.
- This setting can be modified at runtime, for example through JMX.

If you use @Async like this, your application works more stable and have more high perfomance than before.
