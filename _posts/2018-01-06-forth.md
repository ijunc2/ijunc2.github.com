Following last article, I talk about *the Async* in Spring Framework. Basically, when we wanted to use *the Async*, we used Thread such as *Callable* and *Future* or Callback which was mentioned by last article. But, function which is ***@Async*** (annotaion in java) has been provided in Spring. 

Look at the code 1 below

* code 1

This is the example for the Async in Spring. Before we talk about Async, I explain about ApplicationRunner(line:28). This is *the Bean* for executing something without containers such as ***Tomcat*** and ***Jetty*** etc at first. When you execute this code, Spring runs a code which is in *ApplicationRunner* and will be finished. In other words, it is a component for executing something what you want to do without containers. And in order to use the Async, *@Async* was used(line:9-20).(***@EnableAsync*** is essential to use ***Async*** in line:5). When method which had *@Async* was called, they executed with new Thread.

This component doesn't return the result because they have a type of the return which is ***void***. But, sometimes, we need to return specific types which are ***String***, ***Boolean*** etc. 
For getting a result data from Async, we have two ways. One is to use *Future* and the other is to use *Callback*. At first, I am going to talk *Future*.

Look at the code 2 below 
1. Add this method in TestService class
<script src="https://gist.github.com/ijunc2/9dfd2454d1b96f00440c3c595ac2f487.js"></script>
* Code 2
2. Update ApplicationRunner code.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/ijunc2/ec502003ff3516db0bd84696bad28dfa.js"></script>
* Code 3

When you use primitive types as a return type for Async on the method, Spring can't run this method as Async. You should use ***Future*** type and return ***AsyncResult ***. (line:2 and line10 in Code 2).

And you update the code like **code 3** for getting a result data.

Until now, we have watched how to use *Async* in Spring. Acutally, In the web, we already have been using the Async in socket pool such as Servlet in containers which are Tomcat, Jetty etc. So we don't need to use Async without special situation for sure. So then, when do we use Async method like this? It is ***a batch*** which need a lot of time to run something. So, How to?
1. Insert data which is made in Async method in database.
2. Keep the result Future data in web session.
3. ...


And I mentioned there were two ways in order to get result data in Async. One was @Async. What is the other one? 

I will talk it next posting. 

p.s. [**When you use async, you never use @Async without customizing. Then, how to customize the @Async?**](/2018/01/08/fifth.html)
