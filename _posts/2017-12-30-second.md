## Babel ?!

Recently, *Javascript* has been improved a lot. Especially, the announcement of [***ES6***](http://es6-features.org/#Constants) has brought huge changes. But, when we use ***ES6***, [***Node***](https://nodejs.org/ko/) itself is not enough. If you want to use upper version than ***ES6***, we should use [**Babel**](https://babeljs.io/) which is a tool to transcompile upper verion than ***ES6*** to ***ES5***.   

[**Babel**](https://babeljs.io/) consists of some kinds of small modules.

## How To Use Babel
At first, we make a project folder for studying *babel*, and initialize *npm*
> $ mkdir babel_project && cd babel_project    
> $ npm init

#### *Install*

> $ npm install babel-cli -g     
> $ npm install babel-preset-es2015 --save-dev

After setting the project, we make codes for testing.

#### *Structure*

+- babel_project   
| - node_modules(for npm modules)   
| - dist(folder for build files)   
| - src(folder for source codes for testing)   
...| +- main.js   
...| +- ijunc.js   
| package.json   
| .babelrc   

Using babel as a tool to transcompile to **ES5** needs a file which is '*.babelrc*'.   
```
{
  "presets": [
    "es2015"
  ]
}
```

#### src/main.js

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ijunc2/5416e92d6f70188691f91474e5844c61.js"></script>

#### src/ijunc.js

<script src="https://gist.github.com/ijunc2/75aa018b7202955b51849a2730e918f8.js"></script>

When you want to build and to opearte the file, you can use like below that.

> $ node {file you want to build}

But, 'import' and 'export' are grammars for upper version than ***ES6***. Error is going to happen. you can run the following commands from the terminal:

> $ babel src -d dist

=> babel {source file, or folder which files gather in} -d (or -o) {destination folder or output file.js}

>
**-d** ::  the option passed to Babel for compiling a file. We can also use --out-dir for compiling all files in a directory. The short versions of the options are -o for --out-file and -d for --output-dir   
**-o** :: If you would like to output to a file, you may use --out-file or -o

Let's run code.
> $ node dist/main.js

Like this, Babel has a role as transcompiling ***ES6*** to ***ES5***. Babel is a important tool because ***React*** is written by ES6's grammar such as 'class'. So, if you have some knowledge about Babel & Webpack, you could have better advantages.

We are going to talk about ***Webpack*** next time.
