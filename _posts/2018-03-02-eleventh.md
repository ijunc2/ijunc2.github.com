...This framework would be composed of the two part. One is to handle the servlet requested from the client, which is *Core Package*, the other is to control the business logic, which is *Framework Package*.

### Core Package
1. **ServletManagement.class**: This would be a frame to control the data given to the client in the servlet. This is used the *Singletone pattern* and the *Abstract Factory pattern*. This class has some functions such as initialize(), activeEngine(), destroy() which are to control the life cycle. Especially, in the function is activeEngine(), the business logic would be handled, and the function would be constructed by the *Abstract Factory Pattern*. Also, the important thing is to be going to have an instance which named an *actionsMap* of the type of Map. It has the information which the business logic would conduct.
2. **BeanManagement.class**: This would be a frame to initialize the data of the path which engine would conduct when the framework is started. This is use the *Singletone pattern*.

### Frame Package
1. iActive: As this is an interface, it has a role as the operator in the *Abstract Factory pattern*. In order to the business logic, the class roled by the business logic should be extended the class which is implemented in iActive named *Active.class*. Also, it has a controller for handling the success and the error.
2. **OutputManagement.class**: This is to responed the result operated from the business logic. This is aslo composed of the *Singletone pattern*. It has an instance which is *Output.class* has the function to repond the result to the client.
3. **RequestManagement.class**: This is to deal with the Request.class which is extented by the *HttpServletRequest and HttpservletResponse*. It is also the *Singletone pattern*.
4. **ResponseManagement.class**: This is a implementation to return the data to client. It is the *Singletone pattern*, too.
5. **WorkSpace.class**: This has all functions we need to make the business logic.

The total diagram of the class is below.

The specific things each class are going to be mentioned next article.

ps. Sharing what I want to say, I felt that it is difficult for me to explain or describe what I think.
